<h1>Countdown to Independence Day</h1>

<p>This simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript program creates a countdown timer leading up to Independence Day.
When you open the webpage, it will display a colorful gradient background and a countdown timer
starting from 10 seconds. As the seconds tick down, the numbers change sequentially until it reaches 1.
Finally, the timer disappears, and a bold "Happy Independence Day" message appears.</p>

<p>The countdown is achieved using nested setTimeout functions, making it an example of the so-called
"Callback Hell" anti-pattern, where callbacks are nested within each other. This program serves as a
demonstration of the callback pattern in JavaScript.</p>

Celebrate Independence Day with this fun and interactive timer!
